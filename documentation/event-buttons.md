# Event Buttons
Events may have a set of buttons that are shown upon hovering the mouse on the event.
These buttons are fully dynamic, and are specified using the `eventButtons` array.

Each button should have an [`icon`](./icons.md) and an associated `script` to run when clicked.

Buttons may also include a [`_filter`](./_filter.md) to specify which events may
include the button. This is especially useful for displaying different buttons
depending on the type of event.
