# {title} v{version} patch notes
{copyright-2024}

> {title} is finally here! We are so excited to learn about
your initial experience with our calendar module!

Since these patch notes are the initial notes, no active changes will be written.

## What's planned?
We wish to achieve improved compatibility with other FullCalendar views, as well as
potentially add functionality for printing, and generating a PDF out of the calendar.

We may also create a website in the future, to open up for discussions between our users,
and keep better track of shared interests. This website would also contain all future
patch notes, accessible to paying customers.
