# {title} v{version}
{copyright-2024}

> {short} is finally here! We are looking forward to learn about
your initial experience with our calendar module.

## New Features
### Horizontal Scrolling
This was a feature we got requested at our stand during the EngageU conference.
We've added the option to set a minimum width for each day in the calendar.

Since this is only the *minimum* requirement, it means that days will take up more
space if available, in order to fill the screen of the web viewer.

```json
{
    "dayMinWidth": 200 // Each day must be at least 200 pixels wide
}
```

### Improved Compatibility with Other Views
We have tested most of the FullCalendar views, and are working on making every view
as good as any other.

## What's planned?
We are working on adding functionality for "single use" event templates.
This would open up for using event templates as a waiting list. It can currently be implemented
with custom FileMaker logic, however, adding built-in functionality for this is very much needed.

We may create a website in the future, to open up for discussions between developers,
and keep better track of shared needs. This website would also contain all future
patch notes, accessible to paying customers.
